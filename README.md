# UI Developemnt for Northwind Database
** Course Work "INFO 531 Data Warehousing & Analytics in Cloud" **

## Project Overview:** <br>
This project presents the design and development of a comprehensive Data Management and Analytics System powered by MySQL and Python Streamlit and built on the Northwind dataset, that has been modified to suit academic nature of the project. The primary objective of the project was to transform a traditional transactional database into a fully interactive platform capable of performing seamless data management operations (CRUD) and providing actionable business insights (Analytics). The system integrates a well-structured backend, a robust relational database, and an intuitive front-end interface to support a complete analytical workflow, including data ingestion, validation, CRUD operations, and visualization.


## System Architecture: <br>
•	Database layer - integrating MySQL for data storage
•	Backend layer - Python for backend logic 
•	UI Layer  - Streamlit for the user interface


## Project Structure: <br>
The repo consists of 3 folders:<br>
> app
> database_creation_mysql
> reports
